# Punk-Beer-Web-App

Objective: Use the punk beer api to create a unique project that uses templating to show data on the page using a library like React.

Beer web app with favouriting functionality.

This might seem like a giant leap at first, but focus on building this web app piece by piece. Create the app in the following order;

1 - Template data on the page from a generic API request.

2- Add a search bar, which makes a separate query to a database on request.

3- add favourite functionality which allows us to favourite a card.

4- create a separate route (using react router) which allows you to see all the beers youâ€™ve favourited in the session.

5- Add login page
