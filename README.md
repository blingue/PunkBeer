# Punk-Beer-Web-App

Objective: Use the punk beer api to create a unique project that uses templating to show data on the page. If you’re ambitious, use a front end framework like React.

Finally, your last project will be to continue to work with an API. The punk api (similar to the giphy API) doesn’t require a key to use and provides a lot of information in its responses.

I would recommend creating a similar app to giphy in layout, but one which allows you to have a ‘shopping cart’ or ‘favourite’ functionality. You should then be able to see a separate list of the items you favourited. This will of course not be saved to any database, but will bring a new set of challenges with managing application state.

Beer web app with favouriting functionality.

I would recommend diving into a front-end framework to expand your ability and general understanding over modern web development. Because I work heavily with Facebook’s React I would recommend starting that, and using react create app to get started.

This might seem like a giant leap at first, but focus on building this web app piece by piece. Create the app in the following order;

1 - Template data on the page from a generic API request.

2- Add a search bar, which makes a separate query to a database on request.

3- add favourite functionality which allows you to favourite a card.

4- create a separate route (using react router) which allows you to see all the beers you’ve favourited in the session.

5- Add login page
